# PYTHON CHESS EXTREME Pro Edition
Current version: Pre-Release Beta 1.3.6

## Made by Franz B., Jonas G. and Moritz G.

The idea was to create an easy and not too complex chess game for two players.  
The current goal is 
  - [x] Working Pieces (Moving Capturing)
  - [x] Ending the game
  - [ ] Detect check/checkmate and prevent illegal moves  
  - [x] Integrate Stockfish AI, ~~with different difficulty settings~~
